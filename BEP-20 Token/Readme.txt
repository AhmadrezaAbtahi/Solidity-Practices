This Solidity code is a BEP-20 token smart contract that can be used for creating a custom cryptocurrency on the Binance Smart Chain. It includes an interface for basic token functionality such as getting the token name, symbol, total supply, balance of a particular address, and the allowance of the spender. The contract also has a SafeMath library that provides arithmetic functions to prevent overflows, a Context contract for message context handling, and an Ownable contract that allows only the owner to transfer ownership. The contract sets the token name to "Abtahi", symbol to "Abt", decimals to 4, and the total supply to 210000000000 upon deployment. The constructor also assigns the entire supply to the deployer's address. This contract can be deployed and used as a custom cryptocurrency for various purposes.
