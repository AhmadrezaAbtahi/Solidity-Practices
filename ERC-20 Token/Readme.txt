This Solidity code is a smart contract for an ERC20 token that can be uploaded on Github as an open-source project. The ERC20_Token contract includes standard ERC20 functions such as name(), symbol(), decimals(), and totalSupply(). Additionally, it allows users to check their balance, transfer tokens to other accounts, approve a third-party account to spend tokens on their behalf, and transfer tokens from another account that has granted approval. The contract is licensed under the MIT License and uses Solidity version between 0.7.0 and 0.9.0. The contract is initialized with a total supply of 1 billion tokens, and the ownership is divided between two addresses.
