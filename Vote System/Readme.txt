This is a smart contract for voting in Ethereum blockchain. The Voting contract has two main components: Voters and Proposals. Voters are assigned access to vote by the chairman and can vote only once. Proposals are created during the deployment of the contract and are stored in an array of Proposal structs. The contract keeps track of the number of votes each proposal receives and declares a winner after the voting has ended. The winner is determined by selecting the proposal with the highest number of votes. This contract can be useful in a variety of scenarios, including community decision-making and board elections. It can be uploaded to Github to enable anyone to deploy it on the Ethereum network and customize it for their own purposes.
