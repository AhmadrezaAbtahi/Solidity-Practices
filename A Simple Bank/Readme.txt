This is a Solidity smart contract for a simple bank. The contract allows users to deposit and withdraw funds, and also view their account balances. The contract uses the SafeMath library to ensure secure and accurate arithmetic operations. When a deposit or withdrawal is made, an event is emitted to record the transaction type. The contract is owned by the deployer of the contract, and the owner's address is set during the contract's construction. The contract is compatible with Solidity versions greater than 0.7.0 and less than 0.9.0, and is licensed under the MIT License. This contract could be useful for developers looking to create a basic banking system or as a starting point for more complex financial applications on the Ethereum blockchain.
